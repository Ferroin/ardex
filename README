ardex, an Arduino Nano based I/O expander.

ardex is a piece of software for the Arduino Nano that allows you to
use it as an I2C based I/O expander.  It provides 4 digital outputs,
3 PWM outputs, up to 8 analog inputs, and optionally a simple PRNG.
It is all controlled via I2C, and has a user selectable bus address.

Installation is as simple as opening the sketch in the Arduino IDE, double
checking the values in config.h, and then uploading to the Arduino Nano.

Theoretically, this should work with any ATMega328 based Arduino, but
I can't guarantee that it will work with anything other than the Nano.

The I2C address is 0x55, but it can be set to anything you want in
config.h.
